## Project Description

Assessment project for Skyshi Digital Indonesia that's similar to a Todo app.

## Personal Improvement Compared To Test Application

From the initial application that's shown as an example, I saw that it didn't feel like there was a state binding all pages together, whenever there is an update to an assignment/todo list it would make 2 API calls, one to change the updated value in the server and the second one to refresh current page state.

I saw this and decided to skip the 2nd API call and update the frontend state through the front end itself.
